      "content": "\n## Neo Shanghai\n\nThe sprawling megalopolis of Neo Shanghai arose from the ashes of climate catastrophe and economic collapse in the mid-21st century. As coastal flooding ravaged the original Shanghai, corporations funded the rapid construction of a new city built atop massive stilts and floating platforms.\n\nToday, Neo Shanghai stands as a testament to humanity's resilience and corporate greed. The city stretches across what was once the East China Sea, a glittering expanse of neon and steel that never sleeps. Its iconic profile is dominated by the massive arcology towers of the Corporate District, which rise like monoliths above the sprawling urban landscape below.\n\nThe city operates on multiple levels - from the luxurious upper sectors where the corporate elite reside, to the mid-levels of commerce and entertainment, down to the perpetually dark and rain-soaked streets of the lower districts where most citizens struggle to survive.\n\nDespite its technological wonders, Neo Shanghai is a city of stark contrasts and brutal inequality. Corporate security forces maintain order in the upper and mid-levels, while the lower reaches are largely controlled by various criminal organizations and gangs.\n        ",

      "content": "\n## The Corporate Takeover\n\nIn the aftermath of the Collapse of 2042, traditional governments found themselves overwhelmed by cascading crises: climate disasters, mass migrations, resource shortages, and economic free-fall. It was in this vacuum of power that the megacorporations made their move.\n\nLed by Zheng Dynamics, Arasaka, and MiliTech, corporations began offering privatized solutions to desperate populations. They promised security, stability, and technological solutions to humanity's most pressing problems. In exchange, they demanded unprecedented freedom from regulation and oversight.\n\nBy 2055, the transition was complete in most urban centers. Former government buildings stood vacant or repurposed as corporate headquarters. Police departments were replaced by private security firms. Public services were fully privatized, available only to those who could afford them.\n\nNeo Shanghai became the model for this new world order - the first major city to formally transition to corporate rule under the so-called \"Shanghai Compact.\" This agreement, signed by the 12 largest corporations operating in the region, established the Corporate Council as the city's governing body.\n\nToday, citizenship in Neo Shanghai is tied directly to corporate affiliation. Those without corporate sponsorship exist in a legal gray area, forced to survive in the margins of society.\n        ",

These devices establish direct communication pathways between the human nervous system and external technology, effectively allowing the mind to control machines and perceive digital information directly.\n\nThe most common consumer-grade neural interfaces are:\n\n- **Neural Ports**: Physical connection points typically installed at the base of the skull or behind the ear. These provide high-bandwidth, secure connections but require physical cables for data transfer.\n\n- **Wireless Neural Links**: Subcutaneous implants that transmit data wirelessly. More convenient but more vulnerable to hacking and interference.\n\n- **Full Neural Integration Systems**: Comprehensive implants that interface with multiple regions of the brain, allowing more complex interactions and enhanced processing. Primarily used by netrunners and specialized professionals.\n\nPremium neural interfaces from companies like Zheng Dynamics include features such as:\n\n- Emotion filtering\n- Memory enhancement\n- Dream recording\n- Subconscious processing for problem-solving during sleep\n- Augmented sensory perception\n\nWhile neural interfaces offer unprecedented capabilities, they come with significant risks, including potential neural damage, hacking vulnerabilities, and the poorly understood condition known as \"Dissociative Neural Syndrome\" that can occur when users spend too much time connected to digital environments.\n        ",

After earning dual PhDs from MIT by age 24, she worked briefly for the DARPA neural interface program before striking out on her own.\n\nIn 2031, she founded Zheng Dynamics, initially focusing on medical neural interfaces to help patients with neurological injuries. The company's breakthrough came in 2036 with the first-generation NeoLink system, which allowed direct neural control of prosthetics with unprecedented precision.\n\nAs her company grew, Zheng expanded research into increasingly controversial areas, including consciousness digitization and synthetic intelligence. Critics accused her of ethical violations, particularly regarding test subjects, but corporate protection and legal maneuvering kept her work progressing.\n\nKnown for her brilliant mind and uncompromising vision, Zheng was also notorious for her demanding management style and willingness to push ethical boundaries in the name of progress. Her personal motto, \"Evolution by Design,\" captures her belief that humanity should take active control of its development through technology.\n\nThough officially listed as deceased from natural causes in 2076, persistent rumors suggest her consciousness may have been successfully digitized as part of Project Immortality, her final and most secretive research initiative.

Their true identity remains unknown despite considerable efforts by corporate security forces to unmask them.\n\nRaven first appeared on the scene approximately seven years ago, when they breached Arasaka's supposedly impenetrable financial servers and redistributed over 300 million credits to random citizens in the lower districts. Since then, they have been responsible for numerous high-profile data leaks, security breaches, and digital sabotage operations targeting primarily corporate entities.\n\nWhat makes Raven unique among netrunners is their distinctive digital signature - a swirling pattern of dark code that resembles wings unfurling. This signature, always left at the scene of their intrusions, has become a symbol of resistance against corporate control.\n\nTech analysts who have studied Raven's code work suggest they must possess extremely advanced, possibly experimental neural interface technology, allowing them to navigate the Net with unprecedented speed and adaptability. Some speculate they may be using technologies stolen from Zheng Dynamics' classified research divisions.\n\nSightings of Raven in the physical world are rare and unconfirmed, though most reports describe a figure in a black coat with glowing blue neural interface lines visible at the temples. Whether Raven is an individual or a collective operating under a single identity remains a matter of speculation.\n\nFor many in the lower districts, Raven represents hope against corporate oppression.

Within weeks, global markets lost over 70% of their value, wiping out savings, pensions, and government funds worldwide.\n\nAs economic systems failed, they exacerbated existing climate crises:\n\n- Rising sea levels accelerated dramatically with the Antarctic Shelf Collapse in 2043\n- Crop failures led to widespread famine across previously fertile regions\n- Water wars erupted in areas already experiencing scarcity\n- Mass migration from uninhabitable regions overwhelmed remaining stable nations\n\nTraditional governments, already weakened by decades of declining public trust and growing corporate influence, proved incapable of mounting effective responses. Over 60% of world governments either collapsed entirely or devolved into authoritarian regimes desperately trying to maintain control.\n\nInto this power vacuum stepped the megacorporations, which had insulated themselves from the worst effects of the crash through private currencies, resources, and security forces. They offered stability and solutions at the price of unprecedented control over society.\n\nBy 2046, when the immediate crises began to stabilize, the world had been fundamentally transformed.
