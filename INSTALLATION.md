```

This will automatically check your system, install missing dependencies, and test key components.

#### Using pip

```bash
pip install rich pygame requests numpy scipy
```

#### Using requirements.txt

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### For Virtual Environment Users

```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate the environment
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Game

### Standard Launch

To start the game normally:

```bash
python main.py
```

### With Setup Check

To perform system checks before launching:

```bash
python setup.py
```

### Component Tests

The game includes test modules for specific components:

```bash
# Test ASCII art display
python test_ascii_art.py

# Test animation system
python test_animations.py

# Test new animations
python test_new_animations.py

# Test tactical combat system
python test_tactical_combat.py

## Optional Features

### Ollama Integration for AI-Generated Content

Neon Shadows can use Ollama, a local LLM, to generate dynamic story content.

1. Install Ollama from [ollama.ai](https://ollama.ai)
2. Pull a compatible model:
   ```bash
   ollama pull llama2
   ```
3. Start the Ollama server:
   ```bash
   ollama serve
   ```
4. Enable Ollama in the game by editing `config.py`:
   ```python
   USE_OLLAMA = True
   ```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Terminal Display Issues

- **Problem**: Text formatting appears incorrect or colors don't display
- **Solution**: Make sure the rich library is installed and your terminal supports ANSI color codes

#### Missing Module Errors

- **Problem**: "ModuleNotFoundError" when starting the game
- **Solution**: Run `python setup.py` to automatically install missing dependencies

#### Audio Not Working

- **Problem**: No sound effects or music
- **Solution**: Verify pygame is installed with `pip show pygame`

#### Game Crashes During Combat

- **Problem**: Game crashes with an error during combat
- **Solution**: Make sure all dependencies are installed, especially numpy and scipy

### Running the Diagnostic Tool

```bash
python setup.py
```

This will:
1. Check Python version
2. Verify all dependencies
3. Test critical game components
4. Provide detailed error reports if issues are found
